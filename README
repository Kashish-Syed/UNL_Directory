The UNL faculty staff and student directory.

The UNL_Peoplefinder package contains all the source code for the UNL directory.
Additionally, this package provides an API which developers can use to retrieve
directory information and perform searches.

Maintenance Tasks

The Officefinder "yellow-pages" portion of the site is stored in a mysql database.

Editors:

Editors can be added for any yellow-pages listing and permissions are
hierarchical. We expect 

When the print "Centrex" directory stopped being published, we used the HR
Contact List (go.unl.edu/hrcontacts) to assign a default user to each
department. This list should be updated on a quarterly basis.

The script to update permissions is `data/setup_permissions.php`

Once we have accurate editor information, it's best to work with Linda Geisler
and send a note to all the HR Contacts (SAP coordinators) via the
`scripts/mail_sap_coordinators.php` script.

Jim Liebgott maintains a process which exports the hr_tree.xml file. This file
contains the UNL departmental hierarchy, which is used in the directory.
Jim's process connects to CSN's data warehouse and exports the XML data.

The script `data/update_hr_tree.php` runs nightly (via cron) to find new or
moved units and add/update them in the database. 

The script `scripts/flag_sap_orgs_without_employees.php` runs nightly to mark
units which have no employees or child units and hide them from the directory.
